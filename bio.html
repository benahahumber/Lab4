                        When I was around 5 years old, I moved to Canada and have been living here ever since. I am the
                        eldest of my
                        siblings and I currently live with both of my parents. I'm a huge nerd, and love Marvel, DC,
                        comics, movies,
                        shows, ect.

                        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                    </ins>
                    <p>I spent most of my high school education
                        learning Law, Philosophy and Social Issues courses. After gradudating, I studied Law and
                        Socierty B.A. At
                        York
                        U.
                        I didn't really enjoy it so I dropped it around the middle of the Covid pandemic. I worked for a
                        little bit
                        before
                        deciding that I had a intrest and passion for technology, specifically in the new and booming
                        industry of
                        AI.
